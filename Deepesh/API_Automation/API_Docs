API :   Application Programming Interface
Type of API based on Accessibility:

1.  Public API :  API those are available for public use
2.  Partner API :  API that we can share with business partner e.g. google map API
3.  Internal API :  API that is only available for internal application.
4.  Composite API :  combination of multiple API


# Types of API Based on Architectural Style
1.  REST API (Representational State Transfer) : This API architecture follows stateless approach.
    Rest API user HTTP Methods
    1. GET :  To get the information
    2. POST : To create new entry
    3. PUT :  To update the existing entry
    4. PATCH : To update specific field of existing entry
    5. DELETE :  Delete method.

    # EACH  API Execution return the status code as per the response.
    100 - 199 : information response
    200 - 299 : success response
    300 - 399 : redirectional response
    400 - 499 : client errors
    500 - 599 : server errors

    # Notes guide for response code

2.  SOAP API : (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs: SOAP API maintain state of API execution
    and its heavy in terms of performance as it maintains the cache of API calls.
