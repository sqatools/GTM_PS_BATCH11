API :   Application Programming Interface
Type of API based on Accessibility:

1.  Public API :  API those are available for public use
2.  Partner API :  API that we can share with business partner e.g. google map API
3.  Internal API :  API that is only available for internal application.
4.  Composite API :  combination of multiple API
